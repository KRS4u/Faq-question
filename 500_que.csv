7: what can not be used in object names.
Some background on this: C++ supports multiple inheritance  but C# does not. Multiple inheritance in C++ has always be controversial  because the resolution of multiple inherited implementations of the same method from different base classes is hard to control and anticipate. C# decided to avoid this problem by allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces  which do not contain method implementations  but restricting a class to have at most a single parent class. Although this can result in redundant implementations of the same method when different classes implement the same interface  it is still an excellent compromise.

"2. The shortlisted candidates were grouped into GD groups. as only 150 to 180 students were selected from apti test  the GD was called off  and we r selected for technical interview. there was two panel of tech interview  one for CSE & IT and another for ECE. I was sent to the CSE panel. and after waiting for about 2 and half hours outside the room  I was really afraid of what was waiting for me there inside. I entered into the room and with a smile I shake my hand with the guy sitting in front of me. As soon as he saw my name he got interested  becoz i m chakraborty and he was too. and after doing some  formal talk  he started to ask me about Linked list  array  structure  malloc  free  RAM  cache memory  some simple questions from JAVA  pointers  OSI layers and their functions  CRC  flow error controll etc. As i told him before my favourites are C  JAVA  I answered confidently every questions from these topics. after half an hour of tech interview  he told me ""Ok Avijit its fine  so any question u have ?"" i asked a company related question  and after that I left with a firm hadshake. and waiting for result  after 10 minutes a guy told me to go to the upstairs  and wait for the HR interview  oh god I was selected for HR. So guys from CSE have to b strong in C  JAVA  Networking."

"Questions were fired one after another from deadlock  critical section  memory management. He then again shifted to SQL and gave simple queries to write. I got confused in two and I politely said ""I do not know Sir"". Rest I was confident that I was correct. He tried to confuse me but I remained intact to my points. He then asked basics of C- pointers and functions  preprocessors directives and their functions."
There was no negative marking so you can attempt all the written test questions. Just tick on the multiple choice - objective questions when the time is gonna be over. Out of 180 students only 20 were short listed for the 2nd round. I was one among them.
One additional key difference between interfaces and abstract classes (possibly the most important one) is that multiple interfaces can be implemented by a class  but only one abstract class can be inherited by any single class.

11) what are the cpu scheduling algorithms you know?
How does the scheduler know the time how it should be scheduled.
The interview was quite easy. Most of the questions were from academic project  3 questions were from oops. He also asked me sql concepts like joins  normalization  triggering  indexing. As he is oracle team lead most of the questions he asked me from oracle that I was unable to answer and I just said that I don't have much knowledge in this. He also asked me to write a program to merge two strings. At the end he asked me to rate myself in java as well as oracle. After that he told many things about wipro when I asked him. My technical interview continued for about 35 minutes after an hour results were declared and I cleared my technical round. After that we were asked to leave for home.
D Two threads halted without further execution  each waiting for the lock obtained by the other thread to be released.
"Generally for any interviews we might have heard of having group discussions on general topics but for LG Soft it is completely different. They will give you a technical topic and would divide the crowd into 2 groups. They will give 10 minutes for one group to support their concept and in the same way other group too! What I felt was that it was more like a debate than a discussion. In this round they will not assess our Communication skills or Management Skills rather they would specifically analyze our technical knowledge. For us the topic was ""Procedural Oriented Vs Object Oriented"". I initially  thought that it was an easy topic to discuss but as it is a competition we will not easily get chance to express and support our words. Somehow I tried to convey the things that I know and actively participated in the discussion. After 10 minutes they will change the positions of the 2 groups and would ask you to speak. Now  we should be very careful. We should not repeat the points that were already mentioned by some other people. I confidently discussed with my competitors and somehow qualified in the second round."

Q- What is deadlock and blocking with respect to the transaction?
a) Data Base Writer(DBWR) :: Data Base Writer Writes Modified blocks from Database buffer cache to Data Files.This is required since the data is not written whenever a transaction is commited.
b)LogWriter(LGWR) :: LogWriter writes the redo log entries to disk. Redo Log data is generated in redo log buffer of SGA. As transaction commits and log buffer fills  LGWR writes log entries into a online redo log file.

Abstract classes are closely related to interfaces. They are classes that cannot be instantiated  and are frequently either partially implemented  or not at all implemented. One key difference between abstract classes and interfaces is that a class may implement an unlimited number of interfaces  but may inherit from only one abstract (or any other kind of) class. A class that is derived from an abstract class may still implement interfaces. Abstract classes are useful when creating components because they allow you specify an invariant level of functionality in some methods  but leave the implementation of other methods until a specific implementation of that class is needed. They also version well  because if additional functionality is needed in derived classes  it can be added to the base class without breaking code.
c) Each derived class object has base objects only from the virtual instance

We had to go to Polaris company for interview which is located in Gachibowli  firstly I was shocked to see the campus because its my first MNC which I've entered into. Even security guards room was equipped with AC  that amazes me very much. After some time we've entered into the office  they served us with snacks. The interview in polaris is quite different from others  they will ask you different situations and asks what will you do in that situation and how will you react it  all of them says real life problems  it lasts for 25-30 mins. I was lucky the interviewer is very much friendly to me. He asked many questions  I remember only some of them.

Maintaining genetic diversity is crucial for the long-term survival of any crop. When a crop variety somewhere becomes vulnerable either due to the onslaught of a disease or the soil becoming waterlogged or alkaline  scientists need to breed another variety of the crop for that region. They do this by searching for suitable genes in related varieties and the natural gene pool of rice and introduce harmful features like gene-silencing or change the normal functions of other genes  it would have terrible implications for food security of the rice-eating regions of the world.

A) The number on the overview screen corresponds to the total of LUWs (see  also first question) that were written to the qRFC queue and that have not yet  been confirmed. The detail screen displays the records contained in the LUWs.  Both  the records belonging to the previous delta request and the records that  do not meet the selection conditions of the preceding delta init requests are  filtered out. Thus  only the records that are ready for the next delta request  are displayed on the detail screen. In the detail screen of Transaction RSA7  a  possibly existing customer exit is not taken into account.
In Technical round they asked me about UNIX  In SQL join  Alter  Tables.

COMMIT makes permanent the changes resulting from all SQL statements in the transaction. The changes made by the SQL statements of a transaction become visible to other user sessions transactions that start only after transaction is committed.
You can change the appearance of objects at runtime by changing the named visual attribute programmatically; property class assignment cannot be changed programmatically. When an object is inheriting from both a property class and a named visual attribute  the named visual attribute settings take precedence  and any visual attribute properties in the class are ignored.

Export all of the objects from the tablespace
You have noticed in both your SQL Server 2000 and 2005 instances that when a database grows in SQL Server  there is a delay in the database response. Why is that?
The root cause of class conflict its possessiveness or the acquisitive instinct. So long as the ideal that is to be achieved is one of securing the maximum material satisfaction  possessiveness is neither suppressed nor eliminated but grows on what it feeds. Nor does it cease to be such - it is possessiveness  still  whether it is confined to only a few or is shared by many.
In unmanaged environments the compiler and linker directly compile the source code in to native instructions that are targeted at a specific processor. The disadvantage of this process is that each time you want to run your executable on a different platform you will have to re-compile the code using a compiler and linker that will compile the code that is targeted at the specific hardware. This means that each time you want your application to run on a different platform  you will have to ship the compiled instructions again and again. As this leads to compiling and maintaining multiple versions of the same application  the companies try to create a more generalized compiled version in order to target most of the environments. This process is known as the Lowest Common Denominator approach. This leads to a more generalized program which is not optimized properly and does not take advantages of the underlying hardware infrastructure (processor  cache  etc). Because the CLR supplies one or more Just in Time Compiler for each computer architecture it supports  the same set of MSIL can be JIT-compiled and run on any supported architecture.
b. Read is done when the transaction is not yet committed
Me: Sir actually I have a good concept of object oriented programming. Java had been taught in our college during our B.tech course. But Sir I was also interested about the .Net technology by Microsoft. Just had a curiosity about knowing that. But I have more programming experience in java than C#. I am not so clear about the syntax of C#. But I have the concepts.
8)  deadlocks  and i told abt 4 conditons of deadlocks also
ORA-00001: Unique constraint (...) violated - You are importing duplicate rows. Use IGNORE=NO to skip tables that already exist (imp will give an error if the object is re-created).
Imagine this scenario: I/O completion ports are communictaions ports which take handles to files  sockets  or any other I/O. When a Read or Write is submitted to them  they cache the data (if necessary)  and attempt to take the request to completion. Upon error or completion  they call a user-supplied function to let the users application know that that particular request has completed. They work asynchronously  and can process an unlimited number of simultaneous requests. Design the implementation and thread models for I/O completion ports. Remember to take into account multi-processor machines.
What do you know about ADO.NET?s objects and methods?
This section is also moderate and some questions are high level. There is 10 questions from unix  10 questions from sql  last 10 questions from C  Java  C++ based on your selection when you're starting exam. Better to choose C. Unix and sql is mandatory.
To effectively handle security  you want to minimize the administrative burden. Bob is a member of the Data Entry role  and because of cross training  you do not want to remove him from this role  but you do need to DENY permission to the Vacation table.

Interviewer: What is encapsulation and polymorphism?
Referencing allows you to create objects that inherit their functionality and appearance from other objects. Referencing an object is similar to copying an object  except that the resulting reference object maintains a link to its source object. A reference object automatically inherits any changes that have been made to the source object when you open or regenerate the module that contains the reference object. Any string expression up to 32K:

91. What is difference between UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints?
An interface is not a class. It is an entity that is defined by the word Interface. An interface has no implementation; it only has the signature or in other words  just the definition of the methods without the body. As one of the similarities to Abstract class  it is a contract that is used to define hierarchies for all subclasses or it defines specific set of methods and their arguments. The main difference between them is that a class can implement more than one interface but can only inherit from one abstract class. Since C# doesn?t support multiple inheritance  interfaces are used to implement multiple inheritance.What is serialization  how it works in .NET?
A canvas-view is the background object on which you layout the interface items (text-items  check boxes  radio groups  and so on.) and boilerplate objects that operators see and interact with as they run your form. At run-time  operators can see only those items that have been assigned to a specific canvas. Each canvas  in term  must be displayed in a specific window.

After 2 minutes of brainstorming about the topic monitor asked us to start the discussion  one of my friend took initiative and started the discussion I was really waiting for chance as soon as she completed almost 3 to 4 members of my friends started arguing  being as a girl I don't have a loud voice  I was really disappointed that why am I not delivering even though I have valid points 3 minutes passed away discussion turned out very clumsy and I didn't even speak for once I was actually broken that  everyone was shouting as it is very easy topic panel member was really annoyed with our discussion after few seconds I realized one thing and shouted as much as I can ""GUYS  THIS IS A GROUP DISCUSSION NOT A DEBATE"" everyone was so calm monitor was bit happy and again they started shouting as we are running out of time I concluded the discussion. After 6 minutes of discussion everyone are supposed to give self introduction and speak 1 min of their own topic individually. On the spot he announced the result 9 members got selected for technical HR and I was one among them. Key point to remember to clear GD is Be confident  speak authoritatively and politely  must and make an eye contact with your friends. These are enough to clear GD."

I've attended L&T Infotech Interview through an off campus at Rajalakshmi Engineering College & SA Engineering College  Chennai. L&T Infotech conducted off campus on three days(Aug 6-Aug 8) in two different college as mentioned above. I was Scheduled on Aug 8 at Rajalakshmi College.
14. There is an employer table with key fields as  employer number data  in every n'th row are needed for a simple following queries will get required results.
Then on DAY 2 we had technical rounds.This was also an elimination round. They concentrated on SQL C in general but for NON-IT(ie Mechanical  IPE  Civil---) the technical was also a HR round.
9.why is object oriented programming useful?
In the first round they have asked from C  Java  C++  Data Structure and DBMS. The questions are conceptual and if you have the concept clear then it will be easy for you. The questions are like representation of tree or linked list using C  SQL query like joining  complexity analysis of a C program  any C++ program  method overloading from java  use of super keyword in java  why we use B-tree  string length calculation using pointer  etc.
. Intelligent Agent (OIA): The OIA runs on the target database and takes care of the execution of jobs and events scheduled through the Console.
7.What is the essential feature of inheritance
I explained polymorphism  inheritance.

? See the figure numbers correctly They ask question by just giving the figure no. And also the calculations may also be asked. The results were declared and I cleared the round Technical interview The techinal interviewer asked me to write few programs on c And he almost asked all the topics like Operation systems Information security- authentication authourisation DBMS Data structures Java Prepare well for all the topics HR Its very simple.
You are delegating permissions on your SQL Server 2005 server to other administrators. You have local  single server jobs on one server that you would like to allow another administer to start  stop  and view the history for  but not delete history. This administrator will own the jobs. Which role should you assign?

many threads do u want for this?
Interviews are scheduled for the next day(O no Sunday). My number for the Interview was 60(first in first out).
We must be able to create a after row trigger on table (i.e.  it should be not be already available) After giving table privileges. We cannot specify snapshot log name because oracle uses the name of the master table in the name of the database objects that support its snapshot log. The master table name should be less than or equal to 23 characters. (The table name created will be MLOGS_tablename  and trigger name will be TLOGS name).
"I've said as follows in Deloitte interview - ""When I was in 12th standard  my father again joined our family and did all those things in order to distract me from getting high score in 12th and he has openly said about that too. Inspite of that  I was able to secure 1171 out of 1200 and emerged out as school topper"""
Function key triggers are associated with individual SQL*FORMS function keys You can attach Key function triggers to 10 keys or key sequences that normally do not perform any SQL * FORMS operations. These keys referred as key F0 through key F9.
C is an objective oriented language - yes or no?
A record group is an internal Oracle Forms data structure that has a column/row framework similar to a database table. However  unlike database tables  record groups are separate objects that belong to the form module in which they are defined. A record group can have an unlimited number of columns of type CHAR  LONG  NUMBER  or DATE provided that the total number of columns does not exceed 64K. Record group column names cannot exceed 30 characters.
For long transactions that contain many SQL statements  intermediate markers or savepoints can be declared which can be used to divide a transaction into smaller parts. This allows the option of later rolling back all work performed from the current point in the transaction to a declared savepoint within the transaction.
What does REVERT do in SQL Server 2005?
22. can a database table exist without a primary key ?
Each Fact Table can contain a maximum of 233 key figures.
Can a particular event in SQL Server 2005  such as the CREATE USER command  have more than one DDL trigger assigned to it?
b) Foreign Key Integrity Rule :: The FKIR denotes that the relationship between the foreign key and the primary key has to be enforced.When there is data in Child Tables the Master tables cannot be deleted.
In DBMS  difference between DBMS and RDBMS  joins  keys  normalization and on some important topics.
a.  A public key     b.  A private key     c.  B public key     d.  B private key
So  one must be through with all the java concepts because it also helps a lot during interview because VIRTUSA interviews are done mainly on JAVA. Coming to DBMS  the questions are related to SQL queries. Some bits are from Data Structures like stacks and queues.  There is a less focus on software testing  but basics should be clear and we have to know about types of testing and by whom the testing's are done in real world. The time given for these 40 questions is 40 minutes.

This agent is tasked with reading the transaction log in transactional replication and moving those transactions that need to be replicated to the distributor.
Drive was scheduled for 2 days actually but they finished the things in 1 day only.
Later the HR round was quite simple. I was asked to tell me about myself  my background  hobbies  interests  strengths  Why Keane? And so on. Once again  I was pretty confident in answering which I assume was the key factor which worked out well.
In this  there were to rounds in which a common GD on a topic and 2nd was speaking on anything interesting and worth sharing for 40-45 secs. The key here is to only talk in English and talk to the point and the topic chosen by you should be rich  not common like cricket. 8 Cleared the GD round.
Multiple database support : Oracle has a superior ability to manage multiple databases within the same transaction using a two-phase commit protocol.
The result was declared on 10th of august and the interview was scheduled on 31 october.
7. He asked about inheritance  polymorphism  abstration encapsulation  etc...
"PL/SQL V2.2  available with Oracle7.2  implements a binary wrapper for PL/SQL programs to protect the source code. This is done via a standalone utility that transforms the PL/SQL source code into portable binary object code (somewhat larger than the original). This way you can distribute software without having to worry about exposing your proprietary algorithms and methods. SQL*Plus and SQL*DBA will still understand and know how to execute such scripts. Just be careful  there is no ""decode"" command available."
Objects from unsigned CLR assemblies with EXTERNAL_ACCESS or UNSAFE permissions
anyhow  we were made to sit in room and the hr gave a brief introduction about the software testing...then he gave n object to be tested...
ROLLBACK retracts any of the changes resulting from the SQL statements in the transaction.
We can score maximum of our marks in last two modules where we need to say a story. Irrespective of topic given by machine just highlight the key words and use the sentences given in your versant test paper.
1. Java basics what is object  class  abstraction  polymorphism  inheritance?
Object auditing is the auditing of accesses to specific schema objects without regard to user.
In SQL learn for - Commands that are somewhat internal like COMMIT      etc..but its easy only
- What is encapsulation in C++?
Type export should be performed COMPLETE CUMULATIVE INCREMENTAL. List the sequence of events when a large transaction that exceeds beyond its optimal value when an entry wraps and causes the rollback segment to expand into anotion Completes. e. will be written.
Answer 10: (Moment he said this mind was like ok dude I'm Leaving. I stared at them with blank eyes.) They said do you need a moment? I said yes sir  that will be great. Actually this is my first interviewed and i'm very nervous  I didn't sit for any interview during my graduation. They asked why so? I started to answer but couldn't phrase words correctly and I apologised. They said there was nothing to apologise for and that it was quite natural. Somehow managed to say that back then i wasn't ready for an interview as i didn't have enough knowledge and that things would have been more worse than this(pointing to the blank paper). Then I looked at the formula again and couldn't even figure out how I would store the actual values and the measured ones. I confessed this by saying  Sir My mind if totally blank and I can't even think of how I'm supposed to store all the values. He then helped me by reminding me of arrays. I then somehow coded it in c which was incorrect and he pointed that out.  Then asked me to code the same incorrect one in Python but with proper syntax  which I managed somehow. Then asked if dictionaries are more useful for this scenario as we could keep the values as key and their error as values. I said I would prefer arrays as we need to traverse the entire thing both for errors and the values.
68. A______ class is a class that represents a data structure that stores a number of data objects
The SQL Writer service was introduced to handle access to the data files in SQL Server. It allows backup programs  like VSS  to function while SQL Server is still running.
It is the method of dividing a table which would enable a quick reference.  SAP uses fact file partitioning to improve performance. We can partition only at  0CALMONTH or 0FISCPER. Table partitioning helps to run the report faster as data  is stored in the relevant partitions. Also table maintenance becomes easier.  Oracle  Informix  IBM DB2/390 supports table partitioning while SAP DB   Microsoft SQL Server  IBM DB2/400 do not support table portioning.
14. There is an employer table with key fields as employer number data in every  n'th row are needed for a simple following queries will get required results.
