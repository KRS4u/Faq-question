 dml, Database Management System, This Round Was Bit Tuff  What Ever you Fill in Form As skills & Certification you Mention definitely you have questions on it  I Mentioned Asp.Net As certification  Hr asked to tell me the life cycle of Asp.Net  I replied I don't know Theoretical concepts I know Practical Knowledge  Then Hr Asked Tell Me What you know in Asp.Net I Told Creating Web page Design It Running it Use off Button  Image  File Uploading & connecting it to Data Base  Immediately Hr Asked Tell Me About Joints I Told I don't know Database I know only to use it for project create  update  delete the Table  He asked me You would be studied in your collage Since I am an IT Department Student he asked me I Replied Don't know  Then He asked me abt Bubble Sort I told The Answer  then Asked abt Stack I told The answer waited for result with Fear But luckily I got Selected & gone to Hr Round. (Be Bold To Say No if You Don't know the Answer HR will not take it seriously Then Confusing by telling irrelevant answers),
 encapsulation, Object_Oriented_Programming, Abstract classes are closely related to interfaces. They are classes that cannot be instantiated  and are frequently either partially implemented  or not at all implemented. One key difference between abstract classes and interfaces is that a class may implement an unlimited number of interfaces  but may inherit from only one abstract (or any other kind of) class. A class that is derived from an abstract class may still implement interfaces. Abstract classes are useful when creating components because they allow you specify an invariant level of functionality in some methods  but leave the implementation of other methods until a specific implementation of that class is needed. They also version well  because if additional functionality is needed in derived classes  it can be added to the base class without breaking code.,
 object, Object_Oriented_Programming, "Generally for any interviews we might have heard of having group discussions on general topics but for LG Soft it is completely different. They will give you a technical topic and would divide the crowd into 2 groups. They will give 10 minutes for one group to support their concept and in the same way other group too! What I felt was that it was more like a debate than a discussion. In this round they will not assess our Communication skills or Management Skills rather they would specifically analyze our technical knowledge. For us the topic was ""Procedural Oriented Vs Object Oriented"". I initially  thought that it was an easy topic to discuss but as it is a competition we will not easily get chance to express and support our words. Somehow I tried to convey the things that I know and actively participated in the discussion. After 10 minutes they will change the positions of the 2 groups and would ask you to speak. Now  we should be very careful. We should not repeat the points that were already mentioned by some other people. I confidently discussed with my competitors and somehow qualified in the second round.",
 Sql, Database management system, The interview was quite easy. Most of the questions were from academic project  3 questions were from oops. He also asked me sql concepts like joins  normalization  triggering  indexing. As he is oracle team lead most of the questions he asked me from oracle that I was unable to answer and I just said that I don't have much knowledge in this. He also asked me to write a program to merge two strings. At the end he asked me to rate myself in java as well as oracle. After that he told many things about wipro when I asked him. My technical interview continued for about 35 minutes after an hour results were declared and I cleared my technical round. After that we were asked to leave for home.,
 encapsulation, Object_Oriented_Programming, An interface is not a class. It is an entity that is defined by the word Interface. An interface has no implementation; it only has the signature or in other words  just the definition of the methods without the body. As one of the similarities to Abstract class  it is a contract that is used to define hierarchies for all subclasses or it defines specific set of methods and their arguments. The main difference between them is that a class can implement more than one interface but can only inherit from one abstract class. Since C# doesn?t support multiple inheritance  interfaces are used to implement multiple inheritance.What is serialization  how it works in .NET?,
 inheritance, Object_Oriented_Programming, Some background on this: C++ supports multiple inheritance  but C# does not. Multiple inheritance in C++ has always be controversial  because the resolution of multiple inherited implementations of the same method from different base classes is hard to control and anticipate. C# decided to avoid this problem by allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces  which do not contain method implementations  but restricting a class to have at most a single parent class. Although this can result in redundant implementations of the same method when different classes implement the same interface  it is still an excellent compromise.,
 Sql, Database management system, The SQL Variant type can store all datatypes except varchar(max)  varbinary(max)  xml  text  ntext  rowversion/timestamp (thought the data of a rowversion can be stored in a binary(8)  which can be stored in a sql_variant) and sql_variant (it may seem strange that you can?t store a variant in a variant  but all this is saying is that the sql_variant data type doesn?t actually exist as such?SQL Server chooses the best type of storage to store the value you give to it).,
 object, Object_Oriented_Programming, Referencing allows you to create objects that inherit their functionality and appearance from other objects. Referencing an object is similar to copying an object  except that the resulting reference object maintains a link to its source object. A reference object automatically inherits any changes that have been made to the source object when you open or regenerate the module that contains the reference object. Any string expression up to 32K:,
 Sql, Database management system, In the first round they have asked from C  Java  C++  Data Structure and DBMS. The questions are conceptual and if you have the concept clear then it will be easy for you. The questions are like representation of tree or linked list using C  SQL query like joining  complexity analysis of a C program  any C++ program  method overloading from java  use of super keyword in java  why we use B-tree  string length calculation using pointer  etc.,
 Sql, Database management system, So  one must be through with all the java concepts because it also helps a lot during interview because VIRTUSA interviews are done mainly on JAVA. Coming to DBMS  the questions are related to SQL queries. Some bits are from Data Structures like stacks and queues.  There is a less focus on software testing  but basics should be clear and we have to know about types of testing and by whom the testing's are done in real world. The time given for these 40 questions is 40 minutes.,
 Sql, Database management system, Now lady HR started and scanned each application and resume which we had submitted already. She started with one of guy from 5 members. Guys they were observing how you behave for situation. They asked questions like difference between C and C++ and Java etc. Be perfect with your resume. Don't include topics which you don't no. They will trap you easily. They asked some SQL concepts. Mainly they concentrated on projects we have done during engineering  be perfect with it. Be confident and present properly. If you guys get nervous don't show it. Big MNC golden opportunity don't do mistake guys.,
 object, Object_Oriented_Programming, It is the method of dividing a table which would enable a quick reference.  SAP uses fact file partitioning to improve performance. We can partition only at  0CALMONTH or 0FISCPER. Table partitioning helps to run the report faster as data  is stored in the relevant partitions. Also table maintenance becomes easier.  Oracle  Informix  IBM DB2/390 supports table partitioning while SAP DB   Microsoft SQL Server  IBM DB2/400 do not support table portioning.,
 object, Object_Oriented_Programming, A record group is an internal Oracle Forms data structure that has a column/row framework similar to a database table. However  unlike database tables  record groups are separate objects that belong to the form module in which they are defined. A record group can have an unlimited number of columns of type CHAR  LONG  NUMBER  or DATE provided that the total number of columns does not exceed 64K. Record group column names cannot exceed 30 characters.,
 Sql, Database management system, Around 47 students cleared this round. If you clear online test than 70% of your work is done but don't relax. For technical interview  be prepared with one of your core subjects. If you are from ece be prepared with digital electronics/microprocessors and basic programs. Also you may be asked to write program in c/c++/java language(the one language you have chosen during online test). Learn few basic SQL queries related to groupby while etc.,
 Sql, Database management system, Function key triggers are associated with individual SQL*FORMS function keys You can attach Key function triggers to 10 keys or key sequences that normally do not perform any SQL * FORMS operations. These keys referred as key F0 through key F9.,
 object, Object_Oriented_Programming, A property clause is a named object that contains a list of properties and their settings. Once you create a property clause you can base other object on it. An object based on a property can inherit the setting of any property in the clause that makes sense for that object.,
 Sql, Database management system, SQL * DBA - This allows DBA to monitor and control an ORACLE database. SQL * Loader - It loads data from standard operating system files (Flat files) into ORACLE database tables. Export (EXP) and Import (imp) utilities allow you to move existing data in ORACLE format to and from ORACLE database.,
 object, Object_Oriented_Programming, "PL/SQL V2.2  available with Oracle7.2  implements a binary wrapper for PL/SQL programs to protect the source code. This is done via a standalone utility that transforms the PL/SQL source code into portable binary object code (somewhat larger than the original). This way you can distribute software without having to worry about exposing your proprietary algorithms and methods. SQL*Plus and SQL*DBA will still understand and know how to execute such scripts. Just be careful  there is no ""decode"" command available.",
 object, Object_Oriented_Programming, The Open Hub Service enables us to distribute data from an SAP BW system  into external Data Marts  analytical applications  and other applications. We  can ensure controlled distribution using several systems. The central object for  exporting data is the InfoSpoke. We can define the source and the target object  for the data. BW becomes a hub of an enterprise,
 object, Object_Oriented_Programming, The other 25 questions were technical questions based on basic programming logics  java  object oriented technology  SQL  networking  etc and the time was 30 minutes. You could solve either of the sections first but cannot carry the timing of one section to the other one and also there was an option to go back to the questions so you could change your answer if you wanted.,
 object, Object_Oriented_Programming, We must be able to create a after row trigger on table (i.e.  it should be not be already available) After giving table privileges. We cannot specify snapshot log name because oracle uses the name of the master table in the name of the database objects that support its snapshot log. The master table name should be less than or equal to 23 characters. (The table name created will be MLOGS_tablename  and trigger name will be TLOGS name).,
 Sql, Database management system, My technical interview is of about 60 minutes. it seems to be long but when u r inside u never feel it and u just hv to ans patiently as ques are very easy n bit tricky. A good knowledge of SQL and C is a must. U must know at least the basics command of unix otherwise u will be rejected.they will just ask u to write 10 commands of unix and they will ask ques on those 10 commands only.,
 Sql, Database management system, "Questions were fired one after another from deadlock  critical section  memory management. He then again shifted to SQL and gave simple queries to write. I got confused in two and I politely said ""I do not know Sir"". Rest I was confident that I was correct. He tried to confuse me but I remained intact to my points. He then asked basics of C- pointers and functions  preprocessors directives and their functions.",
 Sql, Database management system, "Users normally use the ""connect"" statement to connect from one database user to another. However  DBAs can switch from one user to another without a password. Of course it is not advisable to bridge Oracle's security  but look at this example: SQL> select password from dba_users where username='SCOTT';",
 Sql, Database management system, If you have good domain knowledge and concepts like Java OOPS  DBMS and SQL Queries  Data structures  you can easily crack this interview. Never forget to prepare your final year project. prepare DBMS specially(join  normalization  transaction  acid properties).,
 Sql, Database management system, The correct answer is off ? The TRUSTWORTHY database property indicates whether the installed instance of SQL Server trusts the database such that it can reach out and perform actions outside the database. By default it is OFF such that the database to reduce certain threats that can result from attaching a database that contains potentially harmful code,
