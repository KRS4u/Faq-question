Object_oriented_programming, Object, The interview was quite easy. Most of the questions were from academic project  3 questions were from oops. He also asked me sql concepts like joins  normalization  triggering  indexing. As he is oracle team lead most of the questions he asked me from oracle that I was unable to answer and I just said that I don't have much knowledge in this. He also asked me to write a program to merge two strings. At the end he asked me to rate myself in java as well as oracle. After that he told many things about wipro when I asked him. My technical interview continued for about 35 minutes after an hour results were declared and I cleared my technical round. After that we were asked to leave for home.,
Object_oriented_programming, Object, "Generally for any interviews we might have heard of having group discussions on general topics but for LG Soft it is completely different. They will give you a technical topic and would divide the crowd into 2 groups. They will give 10 minutes for one group to support their concept and in the same way other group too! What I felt was that it was more like a debate than a discussion. In this round they will not assess our Communication skills or Management Skills rather they would specifically analyze our technical knowledge. For us the topic was ""Procedural Oriented Vs Object Oriented"". I initially  thought that it was an easy topic to discuss but as it is a competition we will not easily get chance to express and support our words. Somehow I tried to convey the things that I know and actively participated in the discussion. After 10 minutes they will change the positions of the 2 groups and would ask you to speak. Now  we should be very careful. We should not repeat the points that were already mentioned by some other people. I confidently discussed with my competitors and somehow qualified in the second round.",
Object_oriented_programming, encapsulation, Abstract classes are closely related to interfaces. They are classes that cannot be instantiated  and are frequently either partially implemented  or not at all implemented. One key difference between abstract classes and interfaces is that a class may implement an unlimited number of interfaces  but may inherit from only one abstract (or any other kind of) class. A class that is derived from an abstract class may still implement interfaces. Abstract classes are useful when creating components because they allow you specify an invariant level of functionality in some methods  but leave the implementation of other methods until a specific implementation of that class is needed. They also version well  because if additional functionality is needed in derived classes  it can be added to the base class without breaking code.,
Object_oriented_programming, Object, The other 25 questions were technical questions based on basic programming logics  java  object oriented technology  SQL  networking  etc and the time was 30 minutes. You could solve either of the sections first but cannot carry the timing of one section to the other one and also there was an option to go back to the questions so you could change your answer if you wanted.,
Object_oriented_programming, applet, In unmanaged environments the compiler and linker directly compile the source code in to native instructions that are targeted at a specific processor. The disadvantage of this process is that each time you want to run your executable on a different platform you will have to re-compile the code using a compiler and linker that will compile the code that is targeted at the specific hardware. This means that each time you want your application to run on a different platform  you will have to ship the compiled instructions again and again. As this leads to compiling and maintaining multiple versions of the same application  the companies try to create a more generalized compiled version in order to target most of the environments. This process is known as the Lowest Common Denominator approach. This leads to a more generalized program which is not optimized properly and does not take advantages of the underlying hardware infrastructure (processor  cache  etc). Because the CLR supplies one or more Just in Time Compiler for each computer architecture it supports  the same set of MSIL can be JIT-compiled and run on any supported architecture.,
Object_oriented_programming, Object, If you have good domain knowledge and concepts like Java OOPS  DBMS and SQL Queries  Data structures  you can easily crack this interview. Never forget to prepare your final year project. prepare DBMS specially(join  normalization  transaction  acid properties).,
Object_oriented_programming, jdbc, "Users normally use the ""connect"" statement to connect from one database user to another. However  DBAs can switch from one user to another without a password. Of course it is not advisable to bridge Oracle's security  but look at this example: SQL> select password from dba_users where username='SCOTT';",
Object_oriented_programming, Object, Motorola india -job profile was writing codes/programs for its mobile job location banglore. test paper consisted of 30 objective questions. most of them were electronics 3 c programs-find out mistakes from them.In one of them an int type variable was assigned value using function: int i= func() however the function was not declared earlier.,
Object_oriented_programming, Object, 1. tech test objective questions 20 min 30 qu. covering core java  JSP  EJB  SQL,
Object_oriented_programming, Object, A record group is an internal Oracle Forms data structure that has a column/row framework similar to a database table. However  unlike database tables  record groups are separate objects that belong to the form module in which they are defined. A record group can have an unlimited number of columns of type CHAR  LONG  NUMBER  or DATE provided that the total number of columns does not exceed 64K. Record group column names cannot exceed 30 characters.,
Object_oriented_programming, Object, ActiveX Data Object. ADO can access data from both flat files as well as the databases. I.e.  It is encapsulation of DAO  RDO  and OLE that is why we call it as OLE-DB Technology. Objects are Connection  Record Set  Command  Parameter  field  Error  Property.,
Object_oriented_programming, thread, First-round which was Aptitude round has happened at our college. There were mainly two parts of the paper. The first part consists of questions and the second one was the coding round. In first parts  Questions are mainly from the Software engineering  Java  Database  quantitative aptitude  and English. The question was easy but need the basic understanding of these subjects. In the second round  there was two coding question. We can only choose java as a coding language. The question was easy  If you have knowledge about Collection  Thread in java then you can very easily do these questions.,
Object_oriented_programming, Object, The Open Hub Service enables us to distribute data from an SAP BW system  into external Data Marts  analytical applications  and other applications. We  can ensure controlled distribution using several systems. The central object for  exporting data is the InfoSpoke. We can define the source and the target object  for the data. BW becomes a hub of an enterprise,
Object_oriented_programming, Object, "Coding "" Decoding  Blood relations  Directional Sense  Objective Reasoning  Selection decision tables  Puzzles  Coding Pattern  Number series Pattern  Analogy Logical word sufficiency  Data sufficiency.).",
Object_oriented_programming, Object, A canvas-view is the background object on which you layout the interface items (text-items  check boxes  radio groups  and so on.) and boilerplate objects that operators see and interact with as they run your form. At run-time  operators can see only those items that have been assigned to a specific canvas. Each canvas  in term  must be displayed in a specific window.,
Database Management System, ddl, This Round Was Bit Tuff  What Ever you Fill in Form As skills & Certification you Mention definitely you have questions on it  I Mentioned Asp.Net As certification  Hr asked to tell me the life cycle of Asp.Net  I replied I don't know Theoretical concepts I know Practical Knowledge  Then Hr Asked Tell Me What you know in Asp.Net I Told Creating Web page Design It Running it Use off Button  Image  File Uploading & connecting it to Data Base  Immediately Hr Asked Tell Me About Joints I Told I don't know Database I know only to use it for project create  update  delete the Table  He asked me You would be studied in your collage Since I am an IT Department Student he asked me I Replied Don't know  Then He asked me abt Bubble Sort I told The Answer  then Asked abt Stack I told The answer waited for result with Fear But luckily I got Selected & gone to Hr Round. (Be Bold To Say No if You Don't know the Answer HR will not take it seriously Then Confusing by telling irrelevant answers),
Database Management System, keys, Answer 10: (Moment he said this mind was like ok dude I'm Leaving. I stared at them with blank eyes.) They said do you need a moment? I said yes sir  that will be great. Actually this is my first interviewed and i'm very nervous  I didn't sit for any interview during my graduation. They asked why so? I started to answer but couldn't phrase words correctly and I apologised. They said there was nothing to apologise for and that it was quite natural. Somehow managed to say that back then i wasn't ready for an interview as i didn't have enough knowledge and that things would have been more worse than this(pointing to the blank paper). Then I looked at the formula again and couldn't even figure out how I would store the actual values and the measured ones. I confessed this by saying  Sir My mind if totally blank and I can't even think of how I'm supposed to store all the values. He then helped me by reminding me of arrays. I then somehow coded it in c which was incorrect and he pointed that out.  Then asked me to code the same incorrect one in Python but with proper syntax  which I managed somehow. Then asked if dictionaries are more useful for this scenario as we could keep the values as key and their error as values. I said I would prefer arrays as we need to traverse the entire thing both for errors and the values.,
Database Management System, sql, In the first round they have asked from C  Java  C++  Data Structure and DBMS. The questions are conceptual and if you have the concept clear then it will be easy for you. The questions are like representation of tree or linked list using C  SQL query like joining  complexity analysis of a C program  any C++ program  method overloading from java  use of super keyword in java  why we use B-tree  string length calculation using pointer  etc.,
Database Management System, sql, So  one must be through with all the java concepts because it also helps a lot during interview because VIRTUSA interviews are done mainly on JAVA. Coming to DBMS  the questions are related to SQL queries. Some bits are from Data Structures like stacks and queues.  There is a less focus on software testing  but basics should be clear and we have to know about types of testing and by whom the testing's are done in real world. The time given for these 40 questions is 40 minutes.,
Database Management System, keys, "Next round was Group discussion  282 students were divided into 19 batches  each batch consists of 15 members and my batch was of 8 girls and 7 boys. Ours GD panel number is 6. We were given the topic ""INTERNET USAGE AMONG CHILDREN"" it is quite easy topic so I thought that I can definitely clear this round. After 2 minutes of brainstorming about the topic monitor asked us to start the discussion  one of my friend took initiative and started the discussion I was really waiting for chance as soon as she completed almost 3 to 4 members of my friends started arguing  being as a girl I don't have a loud voice  I was really disappointed that why am I not delivering even though I have valid points 3 minutes passed away discussion turned out very clumsy and I didn't even speak for once I was actually broken that  everyone was shouting as it is very easy topic panel member was really annoyed with our discussion after few seconds I realized one thing and shouted as much as I can ""GUYS  THIS IS A GROUP DISCUSSION NOT A DEBATE"" everyone was so calm monitor was bit happy and again they started shouting as we are running out of time I concluded the discussion. After 6 minutes of discussion everyone are supposed to give self introduction and speak 1 min of their own topic individually. On the spot he announced the result 9 members got selected for technical HR and I was one among them. Key point to remember to clear GD is Be confident  speak authoritatively and politely  must and make an eye contact with your friends. These are enough to clear GD.",
Database Management System, keys, On 21st I was called for interview  I just had 2 days 2 prepare for the interview  n in Aricent they can ask each n every thing that you must have studied.. I toiled v hard day n night revised almost everything Data Structures  OS  DCN  C  C++  s/w engineering  SDLC  Normalization  keys  SQL  Unix etc.,
Database Management System, sql, Now lady HR started and scanned each application and resume which we had submitted already. She started with one of guy from 5 members. Guys they were observing how you behave for situation. They asked questions like difference between C and C++ and Java etc. Be perfect with your resume. Don't include topics which you don't no. They will trap you easily. They asked some SQL concepts. Mainly they concentrated on projects we have done during engineering  be perfect with it. Be confident and present properly. If you guys get nervous don't show it. Big MNC golden opportunity don't do mistake guys.,
Database Management System, sql, "PL/SQL V2.2  available with Oracle7.2  implements a binary wrapper for PL/SQL programs to protect the source code. This is done via a standalone utility that transforms the PL/SQL source code into portable binary object code (somewhat larger than the original). This way you can distribute software without having to worry about exposing your proprietary algorithms and methods. SQL*Plus and SQL*DBA will still understand and know how to execute such scripts. Just be careful  there is no ""decode"" command available.",
Database Management System, sql, Around 47 students cleared this round. If you clear online test than 70% of your work is done but don't relax. For technical interview  be prepared with one of your core subjects. If you are from ece be prepared with digital electronics/microprocessors and basic programs. Also you may be asked to write program in c/c++/java language(the one language you have chosen during online test). Learn few basic SQL queries related to groupby while etc.,
Database Management System, transaction, For long transactions that contain many SQL statements  intermediate markers or savepoints can be declared which can be used to divide a transaction into smaller parts. This allows the option of later rolling back all work performed from the current point in the transaction to a declared savepoint within the transaction.,
Database Management System, sql, My technical interview is of about 60 minutes. it seems to be long but when u r inside u never feel it and u just hv to ans patiently as ques are very easy n bit tricky. A good knowledge of SQL and C is a must. U must know at least the basics command of unix otherwise u will be rejected.they will just ask u to write 10 commands of unix and they will ask ques on those 10 commands only.,
Database Management System, transaction, Recovery is the process of applying redo logs to the database to roll it forward. One can roll-forward until a specific point-in-time (before the disaster occurred)  or roll-forward until the last transaction recorded in the log files. Sql> connect SYS as SYSDBA,
Database Management System, ddl, We must be able to create a after row trigger on table (i.e.  it should be not be already available) After giving table privileges. We cannot specify snapshot log name because oracle uses the name of the master table in the name of the database objects that support its snapshot log. The master table name should be less than or equal to 23 characters. (The table name created will be MLOGS_tablename  and trigger name will be TLOGS name).,
Database Management System, keys, Me:: (I said a small ex  like this... i showed the door beside me and said like this..) Theif will unlock the door without exact key. and if that thief is given a chance to prepare the lock and key  he will do it perfectly in such a way that  no other theif can unlock it. Just like that if a tester comes to development and writes a code  the code will be in such a way that no other tester can find any bugs in it. So that way i can be a good developer  even though i ma with 1.5 yrs expereienced in testing and away from development.,
Database Management System, sql, It is the method of dividing a table which would enable a quick reference.  SAP uses fact file partitioning to improve performance. We can partition only at  0CALMONTH or 0FISCPER. Table partitioning helps to run the report faster as data  is stored in the relevant partitions. Also table maintenance becomes easier.  Oracle  Informix  IBM DB2/390 supports table partitioning while SAP DB   Microsoft SQL Server  IBM DB2/400 do not support table portioning.,
Operating System, caching, "2. The shortlisted candidates were grouped into GD groups. as only 150 to 180 students were selected from apti test  the GD was called off  and we r selected for technical interview. there was two panel of tech interview  one for CSE & IT and another for ECE. I was sent to the CSE panel. and after waiting for about 2 and half hours outside the room  I was really afraid of what was waiting for me there inside. I entered into the room and with a smile I shake my hand with the guy sitting in front of me. As soon as he saw my name he got interested  becoz i m chakraborty and he was too. and after doing some  formal talk  he started to ask me about Linked list  array  structure  malloc  free  RAM  cache memory  some simple questions from JAVA  pointers  OSI layers and their functions  CRC  flow error controll etc. As i told him before my favourites are C  JAVA  I answered confidently every questions from these topics. after half an hour of tech interview  he told me ""Ok Avijit its fine  so any question u have ?"" i asked a company related question  and after that I left with a firm hadshake. and waiting for result  after 10 minutes a guy told me to go to the upstairs  and wait for the HR interview  oh god I was selected for HR. So guys from CSE have to b strong in C  JAVA  Networking.",
Operating System, deadlock, "Questions were fired one after another from deadlock  critical section  memory management. He then again shifted to SQL and gave simple queries to write. I got confused in two and I politely said ""I do not know Sir"". Rest I was confident that I was correct. He tried to confuse me but I remained intact to my points. He then asked basics of C- pointers and functions  preprocessors directives and their functions.",
Operating System, buffering, Imagine this scenario: I/O completion ports are communictaions ports which take handles to files  sockets  or any other I/O. When a Read or Write is submitted to them  they cache the data (if necessary)  and attempt to take the request to completion. Upon error or completion  they call a user-supplied function to let the users application know that that particular request has completed. They work asynchronously  and can process an unlimited number of simultaneous requests. Design the implementation and thread models for I/O completion ports. Remember to take into account multi-processor machines.,
Operating System, security, You are developing security policy for your SQL Servers and have all of the data entry clerks needing access to a series of tables. You create a Data Entry role and assign the proper permissions as well as add the users.,
Operating System, security, ? See the figure numbers correctly They ask question by just giving the figure no. And also the calculations may also be asked. The results were declared and I cleared the round Technical interview The techinal interviewer asked me to write few programs on c And he almost asked all the topics like Operation systems Information security- authentication authourisation DBMS Data structures Java Prepare well for all the topics HR Its very simple.,
Operating System, scheduling, Also had technical questions. Questions based on algorithms. So be prepared with commonly Asked n used sorting and searching algorithms. Then questions to write output of code snippet Given. All are objective questions.,
Operating System, scheduling, The technical interview was scheduled on 4 September 2017 at Sikkim Manipal institute of technology ( SMIT)   we all visited and after a lot of tension we appeared ...A pre placement talk was arranged on 04 September at 9 am were a short ppt and video related to BOSCH were shared give your full attention to the pre placement talk as many a times questions are asked from three ...Then came the interview round 4 panels were set and we were called one by one ...my advice if they tell at random whoever can come for interview please don't hesitate and go through it.,
Operating System, security, We had to go to Polaris company for interview which is located in Gachibowli  firstly I was shocked to see the campus because its my first MNC which I've entered into. Even security guards room was equipped with AC  that amazes me very much. After some time we've entered into the office  they served us with snacks. The interview in polaris is quite different from others  they will ask you different situations and asks what will you do in that situation and how will you react it  all of them says real life problems  it lasts for 25-30 mins. I was lucky the interviewer is very much friendly to me. He asked many questions  I remember only some of them.,
Operating System, caching, The data dictionary cache is stored in an area in SGA called the shared pool. This will allow sharing of parsed SQL statements among concurrent users.,

Operating System, buffering, Consider the following areas for tuning. The order in which steps are listed needs to be maintained to prevent tuning side effects. For example  it is no good increasing the buffer cache if you can reduce I/O by rewriting a SQL statement. Database Design (if it's not too late):,
Operating System, security, The most restrictive permission set should always be used for .NET assemblies in keeping with a secure SQL Server environment. Only the EXTERNAL_ACCESS and UNSAFE permission sets will allow registry access and UNSAFE permissions are not required.,
Operating System, security, Maintaining genetic diversity is crucial for the long-term survival of any crop. When a crop variety somewhere becomes vulnerable either due to the onslaught of a disease or the soil becoming waterlogged or alkaline  scientists need to breed another variety of the crop for that region. They do this by searching for suitable genes in related varieties and the natural gene pool of rice and introduce harmful features like gene-silencing or change the normal functions of other genes  it would have terrible implications for food security of the rice-eating regions of the world.,
Operating System, scheduling, This is a bit tough round . The interviewer asked about my Academic background and my interest on subjects . He asked me the subjects i have covered in MCA course schedule and tried to cover all the subjects with simple questions and testing our capability in answering  the questions ...asked some live examples for the answers. the session lasted for about 45 minutes. be confident on the subjects you are interested.,
Operating System, scheduling, On 27th July  2010 I received mail from aspiring minds that I cleared aptitude. I was one among 15% of the candidates all over India who wrote aspiring minds. But I checked mail only on 29th evening and GD schedule was on 31st July at 11:00 A.M. I had 1 day left so I prepared only for interview by refreshing topics from electronic devices  8085  8051  C and basics of C++.,
